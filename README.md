# Perfect - SQLite Connector

[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/PerfectlySoft%2FPerfect-SQLite.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/PerfectlySoft%2FPerfect-SQLite)

This project provides a Swift wrapper around the SQLite 3 library.

This package builds with Swift Package Manager and is part of the [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) project. It was written to be stand-alone and so does not require PerfectLib or any other components.

Ensure you have installed and activated the latest Swift 3.0 tool chain.

## Repository Layout

We have finished refactoring Perfect to support Swift Package Manager. The Perfect project has been split up into the following repositories:

* [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) - This repository contains the core PerfectLib and will continue to be the main landing point for the project.
* [PerfectTemplate](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate) - A simple starter project which compiles with SPM into a stand-alone executable HTTP server. This repository is ideal for starting on your own Perfect based project.
* [PerfectDocs](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectDocs) - Contains all API reference related material.
* [PerfectExamples](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectExamples) - All the Perfect example projects and documentation.
* [PerfectEverything](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectEverything) - This umbrella repository allows one to pull in all the related Perfect modules in one go, including the servers, examples, database connectors and documentation. This is a great place to start for people wishing to get up to speed with Perfect.
* [PerfectServer](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectServer) - Contains the PerfectServer variants, including the stand-alone HTTP and FastCGI servers. Those wishing to do a manual deployment should clone and build from this repository.
* [Perfect-Redis](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis) - Redis database connector.
* [Perfect-SQLite](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-SQLite) - SQLite3 database connector.
* [Perfect-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-PostgreSQL) - PostgreSQL database connector.
* [Perfect-MySQL](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL) - MySQL database connector.
* [Perfect-MongoDB](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MongoDB) - MongoDB database connector.
* [Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-FastCGI-Apache2.4) - Apache 2.4 FastCGI module; required for the Perfect FastCGI server variant.

The database connectors are all stand-alone and can be used outside of the Perfect framework and server.
